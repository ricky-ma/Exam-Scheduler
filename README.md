# UBC Exam Scheduler
A simplified version of an exam scheduler for UBC with building and rooms modeled to allow for different room and class sizes. Minimizes the number of exam conflicts among the students using simple and direct logic. Maximizes the number of students in each room for optimal scheduling.
Multiple complex constraints are handled, such as trying to minimize the number of exam hardships and allowing for certain rooms to be split into multiple smaller rooms. Additionally, the solver is tuned to increase the number of students that the system is able to handle.
